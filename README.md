# TRINIT_NeuralNinjas_ML

our project is an innovative machine learning project developed for the NIT Hackathon, with a singular focus on combating sexual harassment in various environments. Leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, our project employs sentiment analysis to detect and address instances of harassment in text data. By analyzing user-generated content, such as messages, posts, or comments, GuardianAI identifies patterns indicative of harassment, providing a proactive and intelligent solution for fostering safer digital spaces. The project aims to empower platforms and communities by integrating our project to automatically identify potential cases of harassment, fostering a more inclusive and secure online environment. The technology's effectiveness will be continuously enhanced through iterative model training and community feedback, ensuring its relevance and responsiveness to evolving forms of online harassment. our project stands as a testament to the transformative power of machine learning in promoting positive online interactions and creating spaces free from harassment.
